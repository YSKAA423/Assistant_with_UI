# Voice Assistant Project

This project was developed as part of my Python Development Internship at CodeClause. It is a comprehensive voice assistant application built using various technologies including CustomTkinter for the GUI, Flask for the backend, and spaCy for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Key Features
- **Voice Recognition and NLP:** The assistant processes natural language inputs and generates appropriate responses.
- **Custom Response Templates:** A set of predefined response templates handle various user queries effectively.
- **Database Integration:** Interactions are stored in a SQLAlchemy database for later analysis.
- **Flask Backend:** Manages backend processes and routing efficiently.

## Limitations
- **Recognizer Limitations:** The current recognizer or PC built-in microphone may not clearly understand input, leading to inaccuracies in responses. Using a better microphone or advanced recognition models can improve accuracy.

- **Response Limitations:** The current assistant depends on predifinded templates for responses.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Response Generation:** Implementing advanced NLP models for more flexible responses.
- **User-Specific Data Integration:** Personalizing responses based on user data.
- **Advanced Features:** Adding task management, reminders, and advanced data analytics for better interaction insights.

## Technologies Used
- **CustomTkinter:** For the GUI
- **Flask:** For the backend
- **SQLAlchemy:** For database management
- **spaCy:** For NLP
